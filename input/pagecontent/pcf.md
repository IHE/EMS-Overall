When an ambulance transports a patient to a hospital for medical care, scene information, transfer 
information, patient assessments, and interventions are only verbally available to hospitals when 
the patient arrives. This results in inefficiencies and potential errors in the patient care process. 
This profile will map the flow of the patient information from the ambulance patient record, 
commonly known as the electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR), to the hospital Electronic 
Medical Record (EMR).
